#   - MPFR_LIBRARY      .. full path to library
#   - MPFR_INCLUDE_DIR    .. full path to include directory
#
# Honors the following optional variables:
#   - MPFR_INCLUDE_LOC    .. include directory path, to be searched before defaults
#   - MPFR_LIBRARY_LOC    .. the library's directory path, to be searched before defaults
